Combined events include one downhill run followed by two slalom runs. All times are added together and the fastest total time determines the winner. The downhill and the slalom of the combined event are run on different, shorter courses than the regular downhill and slalom events.

The super combined is a single run of slalom on a shortened downhill run. The winner is the skier with the fastest aggregate time.


Equipment:

  • reinforced plastic boots
    specific to the competition discipline
  • bindings - secure the skier&apos;s feet
    to the skis
  • gloves - made of leather or synthetic
    material
  • goggles - protect the eyes against
    wind, snow, increased UV radiation
    at high elevations, and glare from
    the snow
  • helmet  - protects athlete from
    injury, should fit the head tightly
  • ski poles - for the downhill and
    super giant are curved
    allowing reduced air resistance
    during descent
  • skis - made of various materials
    (wood or composite fibers)
    individually crafted for each athlete
    downhill skis are 30% longer than
    those used in the slalom, allows for
    additional accuracy at high speeds
  • skin-tight racing suits - made of
    materials that minimize air resistance.

Downhill races are designed to be the longest and generate the highest speed from the skiers. Each skier makes one run only. The skier with the fastest time is the winner. Skiers are timed to one hundredth of a second in all Alpine events and any ties stand as that.
                    
A typical Downhill course begins at or near the top of the mountain on a piste that is closed off to the public and groomed specially for the race. Gates are farther apart.

The course is designed to challenge the best skiers:
  • skiing at high speeds
  • challenging turns, shallow dips,
    flats, and small airs (jumps)
    some jumps intended to complicate
    the run
                    
Racers are allowed extensive preparation for the race, which includes daily course inspection and discussion with their coaches and teammates as well as several practice runs before the actual race. Racers do not make any unnecessary turns while on the course, and try to do everything they can to maintain the most aerodynamic position while negotiating turns and jumps.
                    
The Downhill race is a single &quot;run.&quot; Times are typically between 1:30  and 2:30 minutes. Tenths, hundredths and thousandths of seconds count: medals have been decided by as little as one or two hundredths of a second, and ties are possible.

Giant slalom races are similar to the slalom races, but there are fewer gates and wider turns are required to navigate through them. As in slalom, skiers make two runs down two different courses on the same slope in the same day. The times of both runs are added together, and the fastest total time determines the winner.
                    
Giant slalom and slalom make up the technical events in alpine ski racing. This category separates them from the speed events of super-G and downhill. The technical events are normally composed of two runs, held on different courses on the same ski run.The vertical drop for a GS course must be 250 - 450 metres (820 - 1476 ft). The number of gates in this event is 56 - 70. A racer may hit speeds of 50+ mph. Faster events such as super-G, can reach speeds 80+ mph, and slower events such as slalom averaging out at 25- mph.

Slalom races are traditionally the shortest race. They contain close turns or gates. Each competitor makes one run, then the course is reset on the same slope, but the position of the gates are changed. The same day, those skiers qualifying for the second run make their run. The fastest combined times of the two runs is the winner.

The word &quot;Slalom&quot; is from the Morgedal/Seljord dialect of Norwegian: &quot;sla,&quot; meaning slightly inclining hillside, and &quot;lom,&quot; meaning track after skis. In the early 1980s, bamboo poles (also called &quot;gates&quot;) were replaced by hard plastic poles, hinged at the base. The rigid nature of the old-style bamboo gates had forced skiers to maneuver their entire body around each gate, while the hinged gates require only that the skis and boots of the skier (as the FIS rules state) go around each gate. The new gates allowed skiers to take a much more direct path down a slalom course through the process of &quot;cross-blocking&quot; or &quot;shinning&quot; the gates. Cross-blocking is a technique in which a skier&apos;s legs go around the gate with their upper body inclined toward, or even across, the gate; in this case the skier&apos;s outside pole and their shinguards hit the gate, knocking it down and out of the way.

The distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane, in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors&apos; starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.

				<key>Description</key>
				<string>
This event combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski around a cross-country trial system, and where the total distance is broken up by either two or four shooting rounds, half in prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant&apos;s total running distance/time. As in most races, the contestant with the shortest total time wins.
                    
For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; each missed target must be &quot;atoned for&quot; in one of three ways, depending on the competition format:
                    
  • skiing around a 150 metres
    (490 ft) penalty loop, typically
    taking 20 - 30 seconds (running time
    depending on weather/snow conditions)
  • having one minute added to a skier&apos;s
    total time
  • having to use an &quot;extra cartridge&quot;
    (placed at the shooting range)
    to finish off the target
    only three such &quot;extras&quot; are available
    for each round
    a penalty loop must be made for each
    of the targets left standing

In order to keep track of the contestants&apos; progress and relative standing throughout a race, split times (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round. Display screens will typically list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.
                    
Equipment:
  • no equipment other than skis and
    ski poles may be used to move along
    the track
  • minimum ski length is the height of
    the skier less 4 centimetres (1.6 in)
    • small bore rifle, which weighs at least

				<key>Rules</key>
				<string>
The distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane, in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors&apos; starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.

This event combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski around a cross-country trial system, and where the total distance is broken up by either two or four shooting rounds, half in prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant&apos;s total running distance/time. As in most races, the contestant with the shortest total time wins.
                    
For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets; each missed target must be &quot;atoned for&quot; in one of three ways, depending on the competition format:
                    
  • skiing around a 150 metres
    (490 ft) penalty loop, typically
    taking 20 - 30 seconds (running time
    depending on weather/snow conditions)
  • having one minute added to a skier&apos;s
    total time
  • having to use an &quot;extra cartridge&quot;
    (placed at the shooting range)
    to finish off the target
    only three such &quot;extras&quot; are available
    for each round
    a penalty loop must be made for each
    of the targets left standing

In order to keep track of the contestants&apos; progress and relative standing throughout a race, split times (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round. The large display screens list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.
                    
Equipment:
  • no equipment other than skis and
    ski poles may be used to move along
    the track
  • minimum ski length is the height of
    the skier less 4 centimetres (1.6 in)
    • small bore rifle, which weighs at least
    3.5 kilograms (7.7 lb),

The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski 7.5 kilometres (4.7 mi), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team&apos;s next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number, then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis.

In a pursuit, biathletes&apos; starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race, most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order), and each miss means a penalty loop of 150 m.

Individual runs down the course, or &quot;heats&quot;, begin from a standing start, with the crew pushing the sled for up to 50 meters before boarding; though the pilot does not steer, grooves in the ice make steering unnecessary until the sled leaves the starting area. Race times are recorded in hundredths of seconds, so even seemingly minor errors- especially those at the beginning, which affect the remainder of the heat- can have a measurable impact on the final race standings.The men&apos;s and women&apos;s standings for normal races are calculated over the aggregate of two runs or heats. Competitions consist of four heats.

Teams of two, a brakeman and a pilot, make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled. Crews must push sleds from a standing start up to 50 m&apos;s. Each team has four runs held over a two day period. The 4 timed runs, timed to 0.01 seconds, are combined to calculate the final score. In the case of a tie, the same place is awarded.
                    
Although sledding on snow or ice had been popular in many northern countries, bobsleighing is a relatively modern sport. It originates from two crestas (skeleton sleds) being attached together with a board and a steering mechanism being attached to the front cresta. The name of the sport appeared when competitors adopted the technique of bobbing back and forth inside the sled to increase its speed
                    
Modern tracks are made of concrete, coated with ice. They are required to have at least one straight section and one labyrinth (three turns in quick succession without a straight section). A modern track should be 1200 to 1300 meters long and have at least fifteen curves. Speeds may exceed 120 km/h, and some curves can subject the crews to as much as 5 g.

Equipment:
  • sleigh - consists of a main hull,
    a frame, a front and rear axle,
    and two sets of independent steel
    runners.
  • driver controls the sled with his hands
    and fingers, using rings that are

Curling is a sport in which players slide stones across a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric rings. It is related to bowls, boule and shuffleboard. Two teams, each of four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished 19.96 kg  granite stones, also called &quot;rocks&quot;, across the ice curling sheet towards the “house”, a circular target marked on the ice. Each game has 10 “ends”. Each team alternately steers eight stones, 2 stones per person, per team. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end, which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game consists of ten ends.

The curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides, and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet, using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone. A great deal of strategy and teamwork goes into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve. This gives curling its nickname of &quot;chess on ice&quot;

Many different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:

Guards are thrown in front of the house in the free guard zone, usually to protect the shot-rock (the stone closest to the button at the time) or to make the opposing team&apos;s shot difficult. Guard shots include the centre-guard, on the centreline and the corner-guards to the left or right sides of the centre line. See Free Guard Zone below.

Draws are thrown only to reach the house. Draw shots include raise and angle-raise, come-around, and freeze shots.

Takeouts are intended to remove stones from play and include the peel, hit-and-roll and double shots.

Equipment:

  • broom - used to sweep the ice surface
    in front of the stone
    sweeping creates a film of water between
    the stone and the ice, which reduces
    friction, thereby reducing the stone’s
    deceleration and straightening its
    trajectory or &apos;curl&apos;
    brooms can have fabric, hog hair,
    or horsehair heads
  • special curling shoes - different soles
    one has an extremely slippery sole
    made from Teflon, plastic or steel
    used on the sliding foot
    the other is made from rubber and
    provides much needed traction on
    the ice
  • Curling Stones - traditionally produced
    in Scotland and made of extremely rare
    and dense granite
    each stone weighs 19.96 kg
    is polished and is circular in shape

  • playing surface - 45.72 m long
    not more than 5 m wide
    a target — or house — at either end

Judged on following:

Skating Skills
Definition: Overall skating quality: edge control and flow over the ice surface demonstrated by a command of the skating vocabulary (edges, steps, turns, etc.), the clarity of technique and use of effortless power to accelerate and vary speed

Transitions/Linking Footwork and Movement
Definition: The varied and/or intricate footwork, positions, movements and holds that link all elements. In singles, pairs and synchronized skating, this also includes the entrances and exits of technical elements.

Performance/Execution
Definition: Performance is the involvement of the skater/couple/teams physically, emotionally and intellectually as they translate the intent of the music and choreography. Execution is the quality of movement and precision in delivery. This includes harmony of movement in pairs, ice dancing and synchronized skating.
Choreography/Composition

Definition: An intentional, developed and/or original arrangement of all types of movements according to the principles of proportion, unity, space, pattern, structure and phrasing.

Interpretation
Definition: The personal and creative translation of the music to movement on ice.

In 2004, in response to the judging controversy during the 2002 Winter Olympics, the ISU adopted the International Judging System (IJS), which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the 2006 Winter Olympics. The new system is often informally referred to as the Code of Points, however, the ISU has never used the term to describe their system in any of their official communications.

Under the system, points are awarded individually for each skating element, and the sum of these points is the total element score (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to have a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its base value. The technical specialist uses instant replay video to verify things that distinguish different elements; e.g., the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. The decision of the technical specialist determines the base value of the element. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark is called the grade of execution (GOE) that is an integer from −3 to +3. The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, then discarding the high and low value, and finally averaging the remaining seven. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to get the total value for the element.[15]

The program components score (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded in the total element score. The components are:

    Skating skills (SS) reward use of edges and turns, flow over the ice surface, speed and acceleration, ice coverage, clean and controlled curves, multi-directional skating, and mastery of one-foot skating (no overuse of skating on two feet).
    Transitions (TR)
    Performance/Execution (PE)
    Choreography (CH)
    Interpretation (IN)

The only exception is the compulsory dance, which has no choreography or transition marks because the steps are preset. A detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2. Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as "average". For each separate component, the raw marks are then selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a grade of execution. The trimmed mean scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.

The total element score and the program components score are added to give the total score for a competition segment (TSS). A skater's final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.

Ice Dancing exception, pattern dance:
In ice dancing, the pattern dance(s) are scored on only four program components: skating skills, performance/execution, interpretation (see above), as well as a unique component: timing.

Timing
Definition: The ability of the couple to skate strictly in time with the music and to reflect the rhythm patterns and prescribed beat values of the pattern dance.

The Total Element Score is added together to the Program Components Score, which are factored differently for the different disciplines (see below). Deductions are taken for rule violations. The result is the segment score.

Ice Dancing is the only discipline that allows the use of music with vocals. Dancers much adhere closely to the rhythm of the music and express the character of the music with appropriate emotion and feeling.

At present, ice dancing competitions, like those of other forms of figure skating, consist of two programs. The short program combines a compulsory dance—consisting of one or two parts—and certain proscribed elements. The theme and rhythm of the musical accompaniment is determined each season by the ISU the sport’s governing body, while the length of this dance—currently 2 minutes and 50 seconds—is similar to requirements of other forms of figure skating. The free dance has not undergone significant changes over the years and the basis of its scoring remains, the quality of the compulsory elements in close dancing positions, the unison the skaters display and their ability to express the character of the musical selection.

  • boots - made of thick, stiff leather
    extra laces and wide tongues

Ice Dancing exception, pattern dance:
In ice dancing, the pattern dance(s) are scored on only four program components: skating skills, performance/execution, interpretation (see above), as well as a unique component: timing.

Timing
Definition: The ability of the couple to skate strictly in time with the music and to reflect the rhythm patterns and prescribed beat values of the pattern dance.

The Total Element Score is added together to the Program Components Score, which are factored differently for the different disciplines (see below). Deductions are taken for rule violations. The result is the segment score.

In 2004, in response to the judging controversy during the 2002 Winter Olympics, the ISU adopted the International Judging System (IJS), which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the 2006 Winter Olympics. The new system is often informally referred to as the Code of Points, however, the ISU has never used the term to describe their system in any of their official communications.

Under the system, points are awarded individually for each skating element, and the sum of these points is the total element score (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to have a set number of elements. Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its base value. The technical specialist uses instant replay video to verify things that distinguish different elements; e.g., the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. The decision of the technical specialist determines the base value of the element. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark is called the grade of execution (GOE) that is an integer from −3 to +3. The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, then discarding the high and low value, and finally averaging the remaining seven. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to get the total value for the element.[15]

The program components score (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded in the total element score. The components are:

    Skating skills (SS) reward use of edges and turns, flow over the ice surface, speed and acceleration, ice coverage, clean and controlled curves, multi-directional skating, and mastery of one-foot skating (no overuse of skating on two feet).
    Transitions (TR)
    Performance/Execution (PE)
    Choreography (CH)
    Interpretation (IN)

The only exception is the compulsory dance, which has no choreography or transition marks because the steps are preset. A detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2. Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as "average". For each separate component, the raw marks are then selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a grade of execution. The trimmed mean scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.

The total element score and the program components score are added to give the total score for a competition segment (TSS). A skater's final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.

Ice Dancing is the only discipline that allows the use of music with vocals. Dancers much adhere closely to the rhythm of the music and express the character of the music with appropriate emotion and feeling.

At present, ice dancing competitions, like those of other forms of figure skating, consist of two programs. The short program combines a compulsory dance—consisting of one or two parts—and certain proscribed elements. The theme and rhythm of the musical accompaniment is determined each season by the ISU the sport’s governing body, while the length of this dance—currently 2 minutes and 50 seconds—is similar to requirements of other forms of figure skating. The free dance has not undergone significant changes over the years and the basis of its scoring remains, the quality of the compulsory elements in close dancing positions, the unison the skaters display and their ability to express the character of the musical selection.

Judged on following:

Skating Skills
Definition: Overall skating quality: edge control and flow over the ice surface demonstrated by a command of the skating vocabulary (edges, steps, turns, etc.), the clarity of technique and use of effortless power to accelerate and vary speed

Transitions/Linking Footwork and Movement
Definition: The varied and/or intricate footwork, positions, movements and holds that link all elements. In singles, pairs and synchronized skating, this also includes the entrances and exits of technical elements.

Performance/Execution
Definition: Performance is the involvement of the skater/couple/teams physically, emotionally and intellectually as they translate the intent of the music and choreography. Execution is the quality of movement and precision in delivery. This includes harmony of movement in pairs, ice dancing and synchronized skating.
Choreography/Composition

Definition: An intentional, developed and/or original arrangement of all types of movements according to the principles of proportion, unity, space, pattern, structure and phrasing.

Interpretation
Definition: The personal and creative translation of the music to movement on ice.

Freestyle Skiing is a form of skiing which originally encompassed three disciplines: aerials, moguls, and ski ballet. Today, freestyle skiing consists of aerial, moguls, skicross, boardercross, Ski half-pipe, Snowboard half-pipe and Slopestyle and have become part of the Olympics.

Freestyle skiing first began to be contested seriously in the 1960s and early 1970s, when it was often known as &quot;hot-dogging.&quot; Bob Burns, who later went on to create The Ski brand skis, pioneered this style in Sun Valley, Idaho, beginning in 1965. Freestyle skiing began in the 1930s, when Norwegian skiers began performing acrobatics during alpine and cross-country training. Later, non-competitive professional skiing exhibitions in the United States featured performances of what would later be called freestyle.

Aerials:
Aerialists ski off 2-4 meter jumps, built completely out of snow using a wood form during the construction period, that propel them up to 6 meters in the air (which can be up to 20 meters above the landing height, given the landing slope).[2] Once in the air, professional aerialists perform multiple somersaults and twists before landing on a 34 to 39-degree inclined landing hill about 30 meters in length. 
There are two varieties of aerial skiing competitions: upright and inverted. In upright aerials, movements in which a skier&apos;s feet come higher than his or her head are illegal. This is the most common type of aerials competition for junior competitors. In inverted aerials, skiers execute elaborate somersaults and twists.

Aerial skiing was developed in about 1950 by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen.

MOGUL:
Moguls are a series of bumps on a trail formed when skiers push the snow into mounds or piles as they execute short-radius turns. They can also be constructed (seeded) on a slope for freestyle skiing competitions or practice runs. Once formed, a naturally occurring mogul tends to grow as skiers follow similar paths around it, further deepening the surrounding grooves known as troughs. Since skiing tends to be a series of linked turns, moguls form together to create a bump field. At most ski resorts certain pistes (trails) are groomed infrequently or left completely ungroomed to allow moguls to develop. These mogul trails are generally relatively steep. Some trails cannot be groomed because they are too steep, too narrow, or they have obstacles that cannot be overcome by a snowcat. Such trails often form moguls. Mogul trails that can be groomed are usually groomed when the moguls get so big and the troughs so deep that the moguls become difficult to ski on or around. Some mogul fields are also groomed when they become too icy or too hardened to ski safely and enjoyably. Many times a section of a trail will be left ungroomed and allowed to bump up to prevent skiers from gaining too much speed and getting out of control.

Freestyle Skiing is a form of skiing which originally encompassed three disciplines: aerials, moguls, and ski ballet. Today, freestyle skiing consists of aerial, moguls, skicross, boardercross, Ski half-pipe, Snowboard half-pipe and Slopestyle and have become part of the Olympics.

Freestyle skiing first began to be contested seriously in the 1960s and early 1970s, when it was often known as &quot;hot-dogging.&quot; Bob Burns, who later went on to create The Ski brand skis, pioneered this style in Sun Valley, Idaho, beginning in 1965.

SKI CROSS:
Ski cross (also known as Skiercross or SkierX) is a type of skiing competition. It is based on the snowboarding discipline of boardercross. Despite it being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle.

In a time trial or qualification round, every competitor skis down the course, which is built to encompass both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features like jumps, rollers, banks — whatever the course builder can imagine. After the time trial, the fastest 32 skiers (fastest 16 if not 32 competitors) compete in a knockout (KO)-style series in rounds of four. A group of four skiers start simultaneously and attempt to reach the end of the course. The first two to cross the finish line will advance to the next round. At the end, the final and small final rounds determine 1st to 4th and 5th to 8th places, respectively.

Competitors are not allowed to pull or push each other during the KO finals. Any intentional contact to the other competitors will be penalized by disqualification or exclusion from the next race.

Ski cross is a new Olympic event and is currently under the banner of Freestyle skiing even though it is a race without a judged component.

Halfpipe
Ski halfpipe makes its Olympic debut in 2014

Halfpipes originated from surfing and then skateboarding when surfers in California decided that trying to skate in some huge storm drains and empty swimming pools might be a fun thing to do when the waves weren’t pumping. This eventually evolved into skate-specific halfpipe so the athletes could “drop in” (start off on the lip of the pipe).

Skateboarding moved over to the white waves when the snowboard was introduced and the boarders decided they wanted to bring what they had perfected on concrete over to the snow. To make a long story short, skiers saw the boarders flying out of the pipe and felt the desire to go higher. Voila! A new discipline was born.

As the sport has evolved, so have the tricks. Whereas a few years ago 1 1/2 spins and a bunch of grabs were the tricks of the day, now it is not uncommon to see two or three tricks involving two-and-a-half spins as well as double flips or variations of singles in one run. To match the evolution of the tricks, the pipe has been getting bigger and the standard competition pipe is now 22 meters wide.

Pipe Specs (Average)
  • Length: 150 meters
  • Slope: 16 degrees
  • Vertical incline: 83 degrees
  • Width: 22 meters

Jargon
  • Flair: Back flip with a half-twist.
  • Corked: Describes any kind of spin
    or flip that is performed between
    the vertical and horizontal axes
    (either upright or inverted).
  • McTwist: Tilted front flip with
    one-and-a half spins.
  • 540, 720, 900, 1080: 1.5, 2, 2.5
    and 3 spins, respectively
  • Grab : Any part of the ski or binding
    that is grabbed by the hand
    Tail, Mute, Japan and Toxic grabs
  • Ally-Oop: A trick that spins away
    from the fall line of the pipe.
  • Coping: The edge of the pipe.
  • Deck: The flat areas on the sides
    of the pipe.
  • Walls: The sides of the pipe.
  • Flat: The bottom of the pipe.
  • Transition: The area between the
    Wall and the Flat.

Slopestyle
Ski slopestyle makes its Olympic debut in 2014

Slopestyle athletes make their way down, through and over a course comprised of a variety of obstacles including rails, jumps and other terrain park features — scoring points for amplitude, originality and quality of tricks. The discipline has its roots in action sports like skateboarding and BMX biking and has very successfully crossed over into the snow sports worlds of skiing and snowboard.


Slopestyle is one of the most accessible snow sports, as virtually every ski resort has a terrain park where aspiring athletes can learn to jump, slide and jib.

Already an X Games and Dew Tour favorite, the Olympic Games will become the jewel in the crown of this burgeoning sport that has seen its tricks evolve year after year.

Slopestyle tricks fall mainly into four categories: spins, grinds, grabs and flips.

Jargon:
  • Switch - Taking off or landing a
    jump backwards
  • Leftside/Rightside - The direction in
    which athletes spin
  • Switchup - After locking on to a rail,
    hoping off a rail, rotating and
    landing back on the rail
  • Locking on: An athlete has placed
    themselves on a rail with strong
    balance and control
  • Rodeo - Backwards initiated off-axis
    flip
  • Grab - Any part of the ski or binding
    that is grabbed by the hand
    Tail, Mute, Japan and Toxic grabs
  • Corked  Describes any kind of spin
    or flip that is performed between the
    vertical and horizontal axes

In a time trial or qualification round, every competitor skis down the course, which is built to encompass both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features like jumps, rollers, banks — whatever the course builder can imagine. After the time trial, the fastest 32 skiers (fastest 16 if not 32 competitors) compete in a knockout (KO)-style series in rounds of four. A group of four skiers start simultaneously and attempt to reach the end of the course. The first two to cross the finish line will advance to the next round. At the end, the final and small final rounds determine 1st to 4th and 5th to 8th places, respectively.

Competitors are not allowed to pull or push each other during the KO finals. Any intentional contact to the other competitors will be penalized by disqualification or exclusion from the next race.

Ski cross is a new Olympic event and is currently under the banner of Freestyle skiing even though it is a race without a judged component.

Freestyle Skiing is a form of skiing which originally encompassed three disciplines: aerials, moguls, and ski ballet. Today, freestyle skiing consists of aerial, moguls, skicross, boardercross, Ski half-pipe, Snowboard half-pipe and Slopestyle and have become part of the Olympics.

Freestyle skiing first began to be contested seriously in the 1960s and early 1970s, when it was often known as &quot;hot-dogging.&quot; Bob Burns, who later went on to create The Ski brand skis, pioneered this style in Sun Valley, Idaho, beginning in 1965. Freestyle skiing began in the 1930s, when Norwegian skiers began performing acrobatics during alpine and cross-country training. Later, non-competitive professional skiing exhibitions in the United States featured performances of what would later be called freestyle. Aerial skiing was developed in about 1950 by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen.

Halfpipe
Ski halfpipe makes its Olympic debut in 2014
Halfpipes originated from surfing and then skateboarding when surfers in California decided that trying to skate in some huge storm drains and empty swimming pools might be a fun thing to do when the waves weren’t pumping. This eventually evolved into skate-specific halfpipe so the athletes could “drop in” (start off on the lip of the pipe).

Skateboarding moved over to the white waves when the snowboard was introduced and the boarders decided they wanted to bring what they had perfected on concrete over to the snow. To make a long story short, skiers saw the boarders flying out of the pipe and felt the desire to go higher. Voila! A new discipline was born.

As the sport has evolved, so have the tricks. Whereas a few years ago 1 1/2 spins and a bunch of grabs were the tricks of the day, now it is not uncommon to see two or three tricks involving two-and-a-half spins as well as double flips or variations of singles in one run. To match the evolution of the tricks, the pipe has been getting bigger and the standard competition pipe is now 22 meters wide.

Pipe Specs (Average)
  • Length: 150 meters
  • Slope: 16 degrees
  • Vertical incline: 83 degrees
  • Width: 22 meters

Jargon
  • Flair: Back flip with a half-twist.
  • Corked: Describes any kind of spin
    or flip that is performed between
    the vertical and horizontal axes
    (either upright or inverted)
  • McTwist: Tilted front flip with
    one-and-a half spins
  • 540, 720, 900, 1080: 1.5, 2, 2.5
    and 3 spins, respectively
  • Grab : Any part of the ski or binding
    that is grabbed by the hand
    Tail, Mute, Japan and Toxic grabs
  • Ally-Oop: A trick that spins away from
    the fall line of the pipe
  • Coping: The edge of the pipe
  • Deck: The flat areas on the sides
    of the pipe
  • Walls: The sides of the pipe
  • Flat: The bottom of the pipe
  • Transition: The area between the
    Wall and the Flat.

Slopestyle
Ski slopestyle makes its Olympic debut in 2014

Slopestyle athletes make their way down, through and over a course comprised of a variety of obstacles including rails, jumps and other terrain park features — scoring points for amplitude, originality and quality of tricks. The discipline has its roots in action sports like skateboarding and BMX biking and has very successfully crossed over into the snow sports worlds of skiing and snowboard.

Slopestyle is one of the most accessible snow sports, as virtually every ski resort has a terrain park where aspiring athletes can learn to jump, slide and jib.

Already an X Games and Dew Tour favorite, the Olympic Games will become the jewel in the crown of this burgeoning sport that has seen its tricks evolve year after year.

Slopestyle tricks fall mainly into four categories: spins, grinds, grabs and flips.

Jargon

  • Switch - Taking off or landing a
    jump backwards
  • Leftside/Rightside - The direction in
    which athletes spin
  • Switchup - After locking on to a rail,
    hoping off a rail, rotating and
    landing back on the rail
  • Locking on - An athlete has placed
    themselves on a rail with strong
    balance and control
  • Rodeo - Backwards initiated off-axis
    flip
  • Grab - Any part of the ski or binding
    that is grabbed by the hand
    Tail, Mute, Japan and Toxic grabs
  • Corked - Describes any kind of spin or
    flip that is performed between the
    vertical and horizontal axes
    (either upright or inverted)
  • 540, 720, 900, 1080: 1.5, 2, 2.5 and
    3 spins, respectively

Competition procedure
                    
A regular game consists of three 20-minute periods, with a 15-minute intermission after the first and second periods. Teams change ends for each period. If a tie occurs in a medal-round game, a five-minute sudden-victory overtime period is played. In the gold medal game, a 20-minute sudden-victory period is played subsequent to another 15-minute intermission.
                    
Penalty shoot-out
                    
In the case of a tie after any sudden-victory period, a game-winning penalty shoot competition takes place to determine the winner.

There are three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck:
  • offside - if player enters opponent&apos;s
    zone before the puck itself
  • icing - shoot the puck all the way
    across both the center line and
    the opponent&apos;s goal line
  • puck going out of play
    when puck goes past the perimeter
    of the ice rink (onto the player
    benches, over the &quot;glass,&quot; or
    onto the protective netting above the
    glass) and a stoppage of play is called
    by the officials
    puck is considered dead
    once it leaves the perimeter of the rink
    
    Penalties:
    For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the&quot;penalty box&quot; and his team has to play without him for a short amount of time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes, and a double minor penalty is two consecutive penalties of two minutes duration. A single Minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the opposing team is on a power play.
    
    A two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as tripping, elbowing, roughing, high-sticking, delay of the game, too many players on the ice, boarding, illegal equipment, charging (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent&apos;s stick), interference, hooking, slashing, kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), butt-ending (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick), spearing, or cross-checking. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a &quot;minor&quot; penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team.
    
    A penalty shot is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a breakaway - “A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.
    An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.
    
    Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one&apos;s hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one&apos;s defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).

Officials:
A typical game of ice hockey has two to four officials on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two linesmen who are mainly responsible for calling offside and icing violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,[42] and one or two referees,[43] who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.[44] The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.

Skaters use sticks to shoot rubber puck into opponents net to score points. Five members of each team skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. Each team has a goaltender who tries to stop the puck from going into the goal. Team usually consists of four lines of three forwards, three pairs of defensemen, and two goalies.

  • forwards
    center and 2 wingers(right/left wing)
    often play as units or lines
  • defencemen
    usually stay together as a pair
    (left/right) based on side they
    carry their stick
  • substitution of entire unit at
    once is called line change
  • substitutions permitted any time
    during course of game
    sub during play is called
    changing on the fly
    


  • players control puck with stick with blade
  • players may redirect puck with any parts of their body
  • may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited form using hands to pass puck to teammates, unless they are in defensive zone
  • prohibited from kicking puck into opponents goal, though unintentional redirections are permitted
  • may not bat puck into net with hands


  • full contact sport, body checks
    allowed
    protect equipment is mandatory
  • high risk of injury
    players moving @30-45km/h(20-30mph)
    physical contact between players
    skate blades, sticks, shoulders
    hips and puck all contribute

Players:

A team must not have more than six players on the ice while play is in progress. Typically, these players are one goalkeeper, two defenders, two wings and one centre. However, fewer players can be on the ice as a result of penalties, and a goalkeeper can be replaced for another skater at any time at the team&apos;s own risk.

Tactics:
  • defensive
    checking - attempting to take the puck
    from an opponent or to remove the
    opponent from play
  • stick checking, sweep checking,
    and poke checking are legal uses
    of the stick to obtain possession
    of the puck
  • neutral zone trap is designed to
    isolate the puck carrier in the
    neutral zone preventing him from
    entering the offensive zone
  • body checking is using one&apos;s shoulder
    or hip to strike an opponent who has
    the puck or who is the last to have
    touched it (the last person to have
    touched the puck is still legally
    &quot;in possession&quot; of it, although a
    penalty is generally called if he
    is checked more than two seconds
    after his last touch)

  • offensive
    improving a team&apos;s position on the ice
    by advancing the puck out of one&apos;s
    zone towards the opponent&apos;s zone,
    progressively by gaining lines,
    first your own blue line, then the
    red line and finally the opponent&apos;s
    blue line
    offensive tactics are designed
    ultimately to score a goal by
    taking a shot
    &quot;shoot&quot; the puck - player purposely
    directs the puck towards the
    opponent&apos;s goal
    forechecking - the act of attacking
    the opposition in their defensive
    zone
    important part of the dump and
    chase strategy (i.e. shooting
    the puck into the offensive zone
    and then chasing after it)

A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to pull the goalie, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an extra attacker on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. Sometimes this leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.


Events and differences

Women currently compete in an eight-team tournament, whereas men compete in a 12-team tournament. The chief difference between women&apos;s and men&apos;s ice hockey is that body checking is not allowed in women&apos;s ice hockey.

As of the 2005â€“2006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for diving, where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a &quot;minor&quot; penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. The foul of &apos;boarding&apos;, defined as &quot;check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards&quot; by the NHL Rulebook is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.
    
    A penalty shot is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a breakaway â€“A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity.

Luge is a french word for sledge. Of the three Olympic sliding sports (bobsleigh, skeleton and luge) luge is the fastest and most dangerous. Competitors lye on their backs on a tiny sled with their feet outstretched in front of them. They reach speeds in the range of 140 km/h(87mph) with sleds that don’t have brakes.

Four luge disciplines
  • Men’s singles
  • Men’s doubles (larger of two team 
     members lying on top for better 
     aerodynamics)
  • Women’s singles
  • Team relay - each team enters 3 sleds 
     (men’s, women’s, doubles)after each
     athlete crosses finish line, they must
     hit a touch-pad that opens gate
     or team-mate, lowest cumulative time
     determines rankings

Equipment:
  • gloves - spiked at fingertips, asset at 
     start and padding motion
  • helmet - clear/tinted visors, extends
    under chin to reduce resistance
  • racing suit - specially designed to 
     reduce wind resistance
  • shoes/booties - special shoes with
    zippers, to straighten out foot when
    zipper is closed, regulations for
    insole and heel

Sled:   
  • 2 bridges -part of sled that connects
    the two runners which the aerodynamic
    racing shell is suspended, made of
    steel, two, one in from one in back
  • grip - each hand hold handle on 
    side of sled
  • 2 runner(kufens) -usually made of
    fiberglass or wood, sliders steer by
    applying press with foot onto the runners
  • pod - aerodynamic shell, serves as
    seat for athlete
  • 2 steels(steel runner) - two runners
    called steels, only part of sled that
    touches surface, attached to kufens
  • no brakes
  • weight: 21-25kg(46-55 lbs) for singles
    and 25-30 kilograms (55-66 lbs) for doubles

Dates:
8 February Men&apos;s singles runs 1 and 2
9 February singles runs 3 and 4
10 February Women&apos;s singles runs 1 and 2
11 February Women&apos;s singles runs 3 and 4

				<string>Procedure:
  • athletes ride in flat, aerodynamic position
    on sled, keeping heads low to minimize 
    wind resistance
  • sled is steered by a mix of shifting weight,
    flexing sled’s runners with calf of each leg
    or exerting opposite shoulder pressure
    to seat
  • sliders ‘visualize’ course in their minds
    before run
  • best times result from following the perfect
    ‘line’ down the track
  • average speed of 120-145 km/h
    (75-90mph) and up to 5G’s
  • mens’ singles start location is near the
    bobsleigh and skeleton start location
  • doubles and women’s singles have
    start location further down track
  • athlete must cross finish line in contact
    with sled

Scoring:
  • runs timed electronically to 0.001 seconds

				<string>Short track speed skating is one of the most competitive events at the Olympic Winter Games.

Unlike its long track counterpart, where Olympians compete for the best overall time, short track speed skating is every man or woman for himself or herself. With skaters racing tightly in packs around a track roughly the size of an ice hockey rink, short track speed skating is fast, furious, and sometimes dangerous, as crashes sometimes occur in this event.

Equipment:
  • skates with long blades
  • skin-tight suits to achieve peak speeds
  • gloves, skaters often touch the ice
    while zooming through the turns
    helmets are mandatory

Dates:
  • five days of the Winter Games
  • 10 February men&apos;s 1,500-meter final
  • 13 February women&apos;s 500-meter final
  • 15 February gold medals will be decided

				<string>Short track speed skating is one of the most competitive events at the Olympic Winter Games.

Unlike its long track counterpart, where Olympians compete for the best overall time, short track speed skating is every man or woman for himself or herself. With skaters racing tightly in packs around a track roughly the size of an ice hockey rink, short track speed skating is fast, furious, and sometimes dangerous, as crashes sometimes occur in this event.

Equipment:

Skeleton reappeared in the Olympics in 2002. Riders race head first down a frozen track or ’run’ (same used for bobsleigh and luge) for minimum distance of 1200m. Ascending sections must not comprise more that 12% of total distance of track.

Sleds travel upward of speeds of 90mph/135kmh forces up to 5g(similar to space shuttle takeoff) Sleds can only be ridden in prone postion(face first on stomach). There is no steering mechanism on sled so riders use torque provide by head and shoulders. Also, no brakes on sled so riders use the rakes on their boots and an upward incline at end of finish line. Riders may leave their sled during run but must cross finish line on the sled for a valid run.The temperature of sled runners  must be 4degreesC of the reference runner, to prevent gaining speedadvantage of heated runners.

Scoring:
Winner is decided on a scoring system based on distance, style, in run length and wind conditions.
                    
Each hill has a target called the calculation point (or K point or &quot;critical point&quot;) which is a par distance to aim for. It is also the place where many jumpers land, in the middle of the landing area. This point is marked by the K line on the landing strip. For K-90 and K-120 competitions, the K line is at 90 metres (300 ft) and 120 metres (390 ft) respectively. Skiers are awarded 60 points if they land on the K Line. Skiers not landing on the K Line receive or lose points for every metre (3 ft) they miss the mark by, depending on if they surpass it or fall short, respectively. The typical meter value is 2 points in small hills, 1,8 points in large hills and 1,2 points in ski-flying hills. Thus, it is possible for a jumper to get a negative score if the jump is way short of the K line with poor style marks (typically a fall). The value of a metre is determined from the size of the hill. The K point is the point on the hill where the slope begins to flatten as measured from the take off.
                    
In addition, five judges are based in a tower to the side of the expected landing point. They can award up to 20 points each for style based on keeping the skis steady during flight, balance, good body position, and landing. The highest and lowest style scores are disregarded, with the remaining three scores added to the distance score. Thus, a perfectly scored K-120 jump - with at least four of the judges awarding 20 points each - and the jumper landing on the K-point, is awarded a total of 120 points.
                    
In January 2010, a new scoring system was introduced to compensate for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and take-off speed are important variables that determine the value of a jump, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be equal for everyone and thus unfair. The jumper will now receive or lose points if the inrun length is adjusted. An advanced calculation also determines plus/minus points for the actual wind conditions at the time of the jump. These points are added or withdrawn from the original scores from the jump itself.
                    
In the individual event, the scores from each skier&apos;s two competition jumps are combined to determine the winner.
                    
Rules:
Ski jumpers below the minimum safe body mass index are penalized with a shorter maximum ski length, reducing the aerodynamic lift they can achieve. These rules have been credited with stopping the most severe cases of underweight athletes, but some competitors still lose weight to maximize the distance they can jump.

Ski jumping is a sport in which skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump and attempt to land as far as possible down the hill below. In addition to the length of the jump, judges give points for style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (260 to 275 centimetres (100 to 108 in)). Ski jumping belongs to the nordic type of competitive skiing.

Individual competition consists of a training jump and two scored jumps. The team event consists of four members of the same nation, who each jump twice.

On April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee officially accepted women&apos;s ski jumping into the official Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Technique:
The ski jump is divided into four separate sections
    1) In-run
    2) Take-off (jump)
    3) Flight
    4) Landing

In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximise the outcome of ultimate length and style marks.

Using the modern V-technique skiers are able to exceed the distance of the take-off hill by about 10%. Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits.

The landing requires the skiers to touch the ground in the Telemark landing style. This involves the jumper landing with one foot in front of the other, mimicking the style of the Norwegian inventors of Telemark skiing. Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the deduction of style marks (points).

Normal hill competitions
  • calculation line is approximately
    80 - 100 metres (260 - 330 ft)
    distances of up to and over 110 metres
    (360 ft) can be obtained

Female ski jumpers
  • need a longer approach than their
    male colleagues to make up for
    their light weight to reach the
    necessary speed

Scoring:
Winner is decided on a scoring system based on distance, style, in run length and wind conditions.
                    
Each hill has a target called the calculation point (or K point or &quot;critical point&quot;) which is a par distance to aim for. It is also the place where many jumpers land, in the middle of the landing area. This point is marked by the K line on the landing strip. For K-90 and K-120 competitions, the K line is at 90 metres (300 ft) and 120 metres (390 ft) respectively. Skiers are awarded 60 points if they land on the K Line. Skiers not landing on the K Line receive or lose points for every metre (3 ft) they miss the mark by, depending on if they surpass it or fall short, respectively. The typical meter value is 2 points in small hills, 1,8 points in large hills and 1,2 points in ski-flying hills. Thus, it is possible for a jumper to get a negative score if the jump is way short of the K line with poor style marks (typically a fall). The value of a metre is determined from the size of the hill. The K point is the point on the hill where the slope begins to flatten as measured from the take off.
                    
In addition, five judges are based in a tower to the side of the expected landing point. They can award up to 20 points each for style based on keeping the skis steady during flight, balance, good body position, and landing. The highest and lowest style scores are disregarded, with the remaining three scores added to the distance score. Thus, a perfectly scored K-120 jump - with at least four of the judges awarding 20 points each - and the jumper landing on the K-point, is awarded a total of 120 points.
                    
In January 2010, a new scoring system was introduced to compensate for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and take-off speed are important variables that determine the value of a jump, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be equal for everyone and thus unfair. The jumper will now receive or lose points if the inrun length is adjusted. An advanced calculation also determines plus/minus points for the actual wind conditions at the time of the jump. These points are added or withdrawn from the original scores from the jump itself.
                    
In the individual event, the scores from each skier&apos;s two competition jumps are combined to determine the winner.
                    
Rules:
Ski jumpers below the minimum safe body mass index are penalized with a shorter maximum ski length, reducing the aerodynamic lift they can achieve. These rules have been credited with stopping the most severe cases of underweight athletes, but some competitors still lose weight to maximize the distance they can jump.

Ski jumping is a sport in which skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump and attempt to land as far as possible down the hill below. In addition to the length of the jump, judges give points for style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (260 to 275 centimetres (100 to 108 in)). Ski jumping belongs to the nordic type of competitive skiing.

Individual competition consists of a training jump and two scored jumps. The team event consists of four members of the same nation, who each jump twice.

On April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee officially accepted women&apos;s ski jumping into the official Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Technique:
The ski jump is divided into four separate sections
    1) In-run
    2) Take-off (jump)
    3) Flight
    4) Landing

In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximise the outcome of ultimate length and style marks.

Using the modern V-technique skiers are able to exceed the distance of the take-off hill by about 10%. Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits.

The landing requires the skiers to touch the ground in the Telemark landing style. This involves the jumper landing with one foot in front of the other, mimicking the style of the Norwegian inventors of Telemark skiing. Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the deduction of style marks (points).

Normal hill competitions
  • calculation line is approximately
    80 - 100 metres (260 - 330 ft)
    distances of up to and over 110 metres
    (360 ft) can be obtained
Large hill competitions
  • calculation line is approximately
    120 - 130 metres (390 - 430 ft)
    distances of over 145 metres
    (476 ft) can be obtained
    individual and team competitions
    are run on these hills
Ski-flying competitions
  • calculation line is 185 metres (607 ft)

Female ski jumpers
  • need a longer approach than their
    male colleagues to make up for
    their light weight to reach the
    necessary speed
  • due to their light weight female
    jumpers reach distances not below
    those of male jumpers

Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in traveling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. Long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just &quot;speed skating&quot;, while short-track speed skating is known as &quot;short track&quot;. The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as &quot;speed skating&quot; and short track as &quot;short track skating&quot;. The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long.

Short-track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic race being 3000 meters. Races are usually held as knockouts, with the best two in heats of four or five qualifying for the final race, where medals are awarded. Disqualifications and falls are not uncommon.

In the individual events, skaters race in pairs on separate tracks (the inner and outer lanes). Athletes switch lanes at every lap in order to skate an equal distance. The 500 meter race is skated twice, with both races taking place on the same day. The final result is based on the total time taken over the two races.

In the team pursuit races, men skate 8 laps, and women skate 6. Two teams of three members each take part in each race. The teams start all at once from different sides of the track. Each skater in a team Â«leadsÂ» the group for a time, skating in front to take on all the air resistance. Meanwhile, his partners fall in behind him. The race comes to an end only when the last skater on a team crosses the finish line.

Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in traveling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. Long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just &quot;speed skating&quot;, while short-track speed skating is known as &quot;short track&quot;. The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as &quot;speed skating&quot; and short track as &quot;short track skating&quot;. The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long.

Short-track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic race being 3000 meters. Races are usually held as knockouts, with the best two in heats of four or five qualifying for the final race, where medals are awarded. Disqualifications and falls are not uncommon.

In the individual events, skaters race in pairs on separate tracks (the inner and outer lanes). Athletes switch lanes at every lap in order to skate an equal distance. The 500 meter race is skated twice, with both races taking place on the same day. The final result is based on the total time taken over the two races.

In the team pursuit races, men skate 8 laps, and women skate 6. Two teams of three members each take part in each race. The teams start all at once from different sides of the track. Each skater in a team Â«leadsÂ» the group for a time, skating in front to take on all the air resistance. Meanwhile, his partners fall in behind him. The race comes to an end only when the last skater on a team crosses the finish line.

In this case, the final result is based on the total time of the two races.

Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in traveling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. Long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just &quot;speed skating&quot;, while short-track speed skating is known as &quot;short track&quot;. The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as &quot;speed skating&quot; and short track as &quot;short track skating&quot;. The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long.

Short-track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic race being 3000 meters. Races are usually held as knockouts, with the best two in heats of four or five qualifying for the final race, where medals are awarded. Disqualifications and falls are not uncommon.

In the individual events, skaters race in pairs on separate tracks (the inner and outer lanes). Athletes switch lanes at every lap in order to skate an equal distance. The 500 meter race is skated twice, with both races taking place on the same day. The final result is based on the total time taken over the two races.

In the team pursuit races, men skate 8 laps, and women skate 6. Two teams of three members each take part in each race. The teams start all at once from different sides of the track. Each skater in a team Â«leadsÂ» the group for a time, skating in front to take on all the air resistance. Meanwhile, his partners fall in behind him. The race comes to an end only when the last skater on a team crosses the finish line.

Short track

  • races are run counter-clockwise on a
    111m track
  • skater is disqualified if he or she
    passes inside the track
  • lead skater has right-of-way
  • skater can be disqualified if they
    cross track another skater by cutting
    off another skater while changing his
    or her own lane
    after two false starts, the skater
    is disqualified
  • a disqualified skater will be given
    last place in their heat or final
  • a skater can be disqualified if he
    or she deliberately impedes another
    skater&apos;s way to slow the skater down

Long track

  • races are run counter-clockwise
  • individual competition - only two
    skaters are allowed to race at once
  • must remain in their respective lanes
  • skaters must change lanes every lap
  • skater changing from the outside lane
    to the inside has right-of-way
  • team pursuit,the only non-individual
    competition form,
  • two teams of each three skaters are
    allowed to race at once
  • both teams remain in the inner lane
    for the duration of the race they

    a blade that isn&apos;t attached to the boot
  • boots are usually made of kangaroo leather
  • spandex skin suit with hoods to reduce
    air resistance

  • shin pads
  • knee pads
  • neck guard (bib style)
  • kevlar suit(optional)to protect against
    being cut from another skater&apos;s blade

    are made by painted lines or marks in
    the ice and movable blocks of rubber
  • track must be 400 metres long
    with a warm-up lane at least 4 metres
    wide inside the competition lanes
    track must also be enclosed within
    a building
  • measurement of the track is made
    half a meter into the lane
    total length of the track is distance
    a competitor skates each lap
      the length of two straights
      one inner and one outer curve
      plus the extra distance skated when
      changing lanes in the cross-over area
      on a standard track equals 7 centimeters

  • 400 m track with inner radius 25.0 m
    has 113.57 m long straights
