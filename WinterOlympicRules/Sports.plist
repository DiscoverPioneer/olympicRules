Competition procedure
                    
A regular game consists of three 20-minute periods, with a 15-minute intermission after the first and second periods. Teams change ends for each period. If a tie occurs in a medal-round game, a five-minute sudden-victory overtime period is played. In the gold medal game, a 20-minute sudden-victory period is played subsequent to another 15-minute intermission.
                    
Penalty shoot-out
                    
In the case of a tie after any sudden-victory period, a game-winning penalty shoot competition takes place to determine the winner.

There are three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck:
  • offside - if player enters opponent's
    zone before the puck itself
  • icing - shoot the puck all the way
    across both the center line and
    the opponent's goal line
  • puck going out of play
    when puck goes past the perimeter
    of the ice rink (onto the player
    benches, over the "glass," or
    onto the protective netting above the
    glass) and a stoppage of play is called
    by the officials
    puck is considered dead
    once it leaves the perimeter of the rink
    
    Penalties:
    For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the"penalty box" and his team has to play without him for a short amount of time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes, and a double minor penalty is two consecutive penalties of two minutes duration. A single Minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the opposing team is on a power play.
    
    A two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as tripping, elbowing, roughing, high-sticking, delay of the game, too many players on the ice, boarding, illegal equipment, charging (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, hooking, slashing, kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), butt-ending (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick), spearing, or cross-checking. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a "minor" penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team.
    
    A penalty shot is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a breakaway - “A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.
    An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.
    
    Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).

Officials:
A typical game of ice hockey has two to four officials on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two linesmen who are mainly responsible for calling offside and icing violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,[42] and one or two referees,[43] who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.[44] The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.

Skaters use sticks to shoot rubber puck into opponents net to score points. Five members of each team skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. Each team has a goaltender who tries to stop the puck from going into the goal. Team usually consists of four lines of three forwards, three pairs of defensemen, and two goalies.

  • forwards
    center and 2 wingers(right/left wing)
    often play as units or lines
  • defencemen
    usually stay together as a pair
    (left/right) based on side they
    carry their stick
  • substitution of entire unit at
    once is called line change
  • substitutions permitted any time
    during course of game
    sub during play is called
    changing on the fly
    


  • players control puck with stick with blade
  • players may redirect puck with any parts of their body
  • may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited form using hands to pass puck to teammates, unless they are in defensive zone
  • prohibited from kicking puck into opponents goal, though unintentional redirections are permitted
  • may not bat puck into net with hands


  • full contact sport, body checks
    allowed
    protect equipment is mandatory
  • high risk of injury
    players moving @30-45km/h(20-30mph)
    physical contact between players
    skate blades, sticks, shoulders
    hips and puck all contribute

Players:

A team must not have more than six players on the ice while play is in progress. Typically, these players are one goalkeeper, two defenders, two wings and one centre. However, fewer players can be on the ice as a result of penalties, and a goalkeeper can be replaced for another skater at any time at the team's own risk.

Tactics:
  • defensive
    checking - attempting to take the puck
    from an opponent or to remove the
    opponent from play
  • stick checking, sweep checking,
    and poke checking are legal uses
    of the stick to obtain possession
    of the puck
  • neutral zone trap is designed to
    isolate the puck carrier in the
    neutral zone preventing him from
    entering the offensive zone
  • body checking is using one&apos;s shoulder
    or hip to strike an opponent who has
    the puck or who is the last to have
    touched it (the last person to have
    touched the puck is still legally
    &quot;in possession&quot; of it, although a
    penalty is generally called if he
    is checked more than two seconds
    after his last touch)

  • offensive
    improving a team&apos;s position on the ice
    by advancing the puck out of one&apos;s
    zone towards the opponent&apos;s zone,
    progressively by gaining lines,
    first your own blue line, then the
    red line and finally the opponent&apos;s
    blue line
    offensive tactics are designed
    ultimately to score a goal by
    taking a shot
    &quot;shoot&quot; the puck - player purposely
    directs the puck towards the
    opponent&apos;s goal
    forechecking - the act of attacking
    the opposition in their defensive
    zone
    important part of the dump and
    chase strategy (i.e. shooting
    the puck into the offensive zone
    and then chasing after it)

A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to pull the goalie, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an extra attacker on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. Sometimes this leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.


Events and differences

Women currently compete in an eight-team tournament, whereas men compete in a 12-team tournament. The chief difference between women&apos;s and men&apos;s ice hockey is that body checking is not allowed in women&apos;s ice hockey.

Equipment:
  • helmet
  • shoulder pads
  • elbow pads
  • mouth guard
  • protective gloves
  • padded shorts(pants or girdle)
  • athletic cup
  • shin pads
  • skates
  • optional neck protector
  
  goaltenders gear
  • neck guard
  • chest/arm protector
  • blocker
  • catch glove
  • leg pads

  • skates
    optimized for speed, acceleration,
    maneuverability, rapid starts,
    stops, turns, changes in direction
    protect feet from contact with
    other skaters, sticks, pucks,
    boards and ice
    blade length, width, curvature
    different from figure skates

  • sticks
    long relatively wide and slightly
    curved flat blade, attached to a shaft
    curve impacts performance
    deep curve helps lift
    shallow curve allows easier backhands

In the gold medal game, a 20-minute sudden-victory period is played subsequent to another 15-minute intermission.
                    
Penalty shoot-out
                    
In the case of a tie after any sudden-victory period, a game-winning penalty shoot competition takes place to determine the winner.

There are three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck:
  • offside - if player enters opponent&apos;s
    zone before the puck itself
  • icing - shoot the puck all the way
    across both the center line and
    the opponent&apos;s goal line
  • puck going out of play
    when puck goes past the perimeter
    of the ice rink (onto the player
    benches, over the &quot;glass,&quot; or
    onto the protective netting above the
    glass) and a stoppage of play is called
    by the officials
    puck is considered dead
    once it leaves the perimeter of the rink
    
    Penalties:
    For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the &quot;penalty box&quot; and his team has to play without him for a short amount of time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes, and a double minor penalty is two consecutive penalties of two minutes duration. A single Minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the opposing team is on a power play.
    
    A two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as tripping, elbowing, roughing, high-sticking, delay of the game, too many players on the ice, boarding, illegal equipment, charging (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent&apos;s stick), interference, hooking, slashing, kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), butt-ending (striking an opponent with the knob of the stickâ€”a very rare penalty), spearing, or cross-checking. As of the 2005â€“2006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for diving, where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a &quot;minor&quot; penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. The foul of &apos;boarding&apos;, defined as &quot;check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards&quot; by the NHL Rulebook is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.
    
    A penalty shot is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a breakaway â€“A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.
    An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.
    
    Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one&apos;s hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one&apos;s defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).

Officials:
A typical game of ice hockey has two to four officials on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two linesmen who are mainly responsible for calling offside and icing violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,[42] and one or two referees,[43] who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.[44] The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.

Skaters use sticks to shoot rubber puck into opponents net to score points. Five members of each team skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. Each team has a goaltender who tries to stop the puck from going into the goal. Team usually consists of four lines of three forwards, three pairs of defensemen, and two goalies.

  • forwards
    center and 2 wingers(right/left wing)
    often play as units or lines
  • defencemen
    usually stay together as a pair
    (left/right) based on side they
    carry their stick
  • substitution of entire unit at
    once is called line change
  • substitutions permitted any time
    during course of game
    sub during play is called
    changing on the fly
    


  • players control puck with stick with blade
  • players may redirect puck with any parts of their body
  • may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited form using hands to pass puck to teammates, unless they are in defensive zone
  • prohibited from kicking puck into opponents goal, though unintentional redirections are permitted
  • may not bat puck into net with hands


  • full contact sport, body checks
    allowed
    protect equipment is mandatory
  • high risk of injury
    players moving @30-45km/h(20-30mph)
    physical contact between players
    skate blades, sticks, shoulders
    hips and puck all contribute

Players

A team must not have more than six players on the ice while play is in progress. Typically, these players are one goalkeeper, two defenders, two wings and one centre. However, fewer players can be on the ice as a result of penalties, and a goalkeeper can be replaced for another skater at any time at the teamâ€™s own risk.

Tactics:
  • defensive
    checking - attempting to take the puck
    from an opponent or to remove the
    opponent from play
  • stick checking, sweep checking,
    and poke checking are legal uses
    of the stick to obtain possession
    of the puck
  • neutral zone trap is designed to
    isolate the puck carrier in the
    neutral zone preventing him from
    entering the offensive zone
  • body checking is using one&apos;s shoulder
    or hip to strike an opponent who has
    the puck or who is the last to have
    touched it (the last person to have
    touched the puck is still legally
    &quot;in possession&quot; of it, although a
    penalty is generally called if he
    is checked more than two seconds
    after his last touch)

  • offensive
    improving a team&apos;s position on the ice
    by advancing the puck out of one&apos;s
    zone towards the opponent&apos;s zone,
    progressively by gaining lines,
    first your own blue line, then the
    red line and finally the opponent&apos;s
    blue line
    offensive tactics are designed
    ultimately to score a goal by
    taking a shot
    &quot;shoot&quot; the puck - player purposely
    directs the puck towards the
    opponent&apos;s goal
    forechecking - the act of attacking
    the opposition in their defensive
    zone
    important part of the dump and
    chase strategy (i.e. shooting
    the puck into the offensive zone
    and then chasing after it)

A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to pull the goalie, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an extra attacker on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. Sometimes this leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.


Events and differences

Women currently compete in an eight-team tournament, whereas men compete in a 12-team tournament. The chief difference between women&apos;s and men&apos;s ice hockey is that body checking is not allowed in women&apos;s ice hockey.

Equipment:
  • helmet
  • shoulder pads
  • elbow pads
  • mouth guard
  • protective gloves
  • padded shorts(pants or girdle)
  • athletic cup
  • shin pads
  • skates
  • optional neck protector
  
  goaltenders gear
  • neck guard
  • chest/arm protector
  • blocker
  • catch glove
  • leg pads

  • skates
    optimized for speed, acceleration,
    maneuverability, rapid starts,
    stops, turns, changes in direction
    protect feet from contact with
    other skaters, sticks, pucks,
    boards and ice
    blade length, width, curvature
    different from figure skates

  • sticks
    long relatively wide and slightly
    curved flat blade, attached to a shaft
    curve impacts performance
    deep curve helps lift
    shallow curve allows easier backhands

Luge is a french word for sledge. Of the three Olympic sliding sports (bobsleigh, skeleton and luge) luge is the fastest and most dangerous. Competitors lye on their backs on a tiny sled with their feet outstretched in front of them. They reach speeds in the range of 140 km/h(87mph) with sleds that don’t have brakes.

Four luge disciplines
  • Men’s singles
  • Men’s doubles (larger of two team 
     members lying on top for better 
     aerodynamics)
  • Women’s singles
  • Team relay - each team enters 3 sleds 
     (men’s, women’s, doubles)after each
     athlete crosses finish line, they must
     hit a touch-pad that opens gate
     or team-mate, lowest cumulative time
     determines rankings

Equipment:
  • gloves - spiked at fingertips, asset at 
     start and padding motion
  • helmet - clear/tinted visors, extends
    under chin to reduce resistance
  • racing suit - specially designed to 
     reduce wind resistance
  • shoes/booties - special shoes with
    zippers, to straighten out foot when
    zipper is closed, regulations for
    insole and heel

				<string>Short track speed skating is one of the most competitive events at the Olympic Winter Games.

Unlike its long track counterpart, where Olympians compete for the best overall time, short track speed skating is every man or woman for himself or herself. With skaters racing tightly in packs around a track roughly the size of an ice hockey rink, short track speed skating is fast, furious, and sometimes dangerous, as crashes sometimes occur in this event.

Equipment:
  • skates with long blades
  • skin-tight suits to achieve peak speeds
  • gloves, skaters often touch the ice
    while zooming through the turns
    helmets are mandatory

Skeleton reappeared in the Olympics in 2002. Riders race head first down a frozen track or ’run’ (same used for bobsleigh and luge) for minimum distance of 1200m. Ascending sections must not comprise more that 12% of total distance of track.

Sleds travel upward of speeds of 90mph/135kmh forces up to 5g(similar to space shuttle takeoff) Sleds can only be ridden in prone postion(face first on stomach). There is no steering mechanism on sled so riders use torque provide by head and shoulders. Also, no brakes on sled so riders use the rakes on their boots and an upward incline at end of finish line. Riders may leave their sled during run but must cross finish line on the sled for a valid run.The temperature of sled runners  must be 4degreesC of the reference runner, to prevent gaining speedadvantage of heated runners.


Equipment:
  • speed suit - skin tight to maximize
    aerodynamics of body
  • helmet with chin guard or skeleton-specific
    helmet
  • gloves
  • spiked shoes
  • googles or face shield
  • optional padding under suit, elbow or

Scoring:
Winner is decided on a scoring system based on distance, style, in run length and wind conditions.
                    
Each hill has a target called the calculation point (or K point or &quot;critical point&quot;) which is a par distance to aim for. It is also the place where many jumpers land, in the middle of the landing area. This point is marked by the K line on the landing strip. For K-90 and K-120 competitions, the K line is at 90 metres (300 ft) and 120 metres (390 ft) respectively. Skiers are awarded 60 points if they land on the K Line. Skiers not landing on the K Line receive or lose points for every metre (3 ft) they miss the mark by, depending on if they surpass it or fall short, respectively. The typical meter value is 2 points in small hills, 1,8 points in large hills and 1,2 points in ski-flying hills. Thus, it is possible for a jumper to get a negative score if the jump is way short of the K line with poor style marks (typically a fall). The value of a metre is determined from the size of the hill. The K point is the point on the hill where the slope begins to flatten as measured from the take off.
                    
In addition, five judges are based in a tower to the side of the expected landing point. They can award up to 20 points each for style based on keeping the skis steady during flight, balance, good body position, and landing. The highest and lowest style scores are disregarded, with the remaining three scores added to the distance score. Thus, a perfectly scored K-120 jump - with at least four of the judges awarding 20 points each - and the jumper landing on the K-point, is awarded a total of 120 points.
                    
In January 2010, a new scoring system was introduced to compensate for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and take-off speed are important variables that determine the value of a jump, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be equal for everyone and thus unfair. The jumper will now receive or lose points if the inrun length is adjusted. An advanced calculation also determines plus/minus points for the actual wind conditions at the time of the jump. These points are added or withdrawn from the original scores from the jump itself.
                    
In the individual event, the scores from each skier&apos;s two competition jumps are combined to determine the winner.
                    
Rules:
Ski jumpers below the minimum safe body mass index are penalized with a shorter maximum ski length, reducing the aerodynamic lift they can achieve. These rules have been credited with stopping the most severe cases of underweight athletes, but some competitors still lose weight to maximize the distance they can jump.

Ski jumping is a sport in which skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump and attempt to land as far as possible down the hill below. In addition to the length of the jump, judges give points for style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (260 to 275 centimetres (100 to 108 in)). Ski jumping belongs to the nordic type of competitive skiing.

Individual competition consists of a training jump and two scored jumps. The team event consists of four members of the same nation, who each jump twice.

On April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee officially accepted women&apos;s ski jumping into the official Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Technique:
The ski jump is divided into four separate sections
    1) In-run
    2) Take-off (jump)
    3) Flight
    4) Landing

In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximise the outcome of ultimate length and style marks.

Using the modern V-technique skiers are able to exceed the distance of the take-off hill by about 10%. Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits.

The landing requires the skiers to touch the ground in the Telemark landing style. This involves the jumper landing with one foot in front of the other, mimicking the style of the Norwegian inventors of Telemark skiing. Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the deduction of style marks (points).

Normal hill competitions
  • calculation line is approximately
    80 - 100 metres (260 - 330 ft)
    distances of up to and over 110 metres
    (360 ft) can be obtained
Large hill competitions
  • calculation line is approximately
    120 - 130 metres (390 - 430 ft)
    distances of over 145 metres
    (476 ft) can be obtained
    individual and team competitions
    are run on these hills
Ski-flying competitions
  • calculation line is 185 metres (607 ft)

Female ski jumpers
  • need a longer approach than their
    male colleagues to make up for
    their light weight to reach the
    necessary speed
  • due to their light weight female
    jumpers reach distances not below
    those of male jumpers

Speed Skaters compete in 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, 5,000m and a team pursuit. There is also a 10,000m for men and a 3,000m for women. In each event, skaters race in pairs against the clock on a standard 400m oval ring. All events are skated once, apart from the 500m, which is skated twice. In this case, the final result is based on the total time of the two races.

Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in traveling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. Long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just &quot;speed skating&quot;, while short-track speed skating is known as &quot;short track&quot;. The ISU, the governing body of both ice sports, refers to long track as &quot;speed skating&quot; and short track as &quot;short track skating&quot;. The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long.

Short-track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic race being 3000 meters. Races are usually held as knockouts, with the best two in heats of four or five qualifying for the final race, where medals are awarded. Disqualifications and falls are not uncommon.

In the individual events, skaters race in pairs on separate tracks (the inner and outer lanes). Athletes switch lanes at every lap in order to skate an equal distance. The 500 meter race is skated twice, with both races taking place on the same day. The final result is based on the total time taken over the two races.

In the team pursuit races, men skate 8 laps, and women skate 6. Two teams of three members each take part in each race. The teams start all at once from different sides of the track. Each skater in a team Â«leadsÂ» the group for a time, skating in front to take on all the air resistance. Meanwhile, his partners fall in behind him. The race comes to an end only when the last skater on a team crosses the finish line.

Short track

  • races are run counter-clockwise on a
    111m track
  • skater is disqualified if he or she
    passes inside the track
  • lead skater has right-of-way
  • skater can be disqualified if they
    cross track another skater by cutting
    off another skater while changing his
    or her own lane
    after two false starts, the skater
    is disqualified
  • a disqualified skater will be given
    last place in their heat or final
  • a skater can be disqualified if he
    or she deliberately impedes another
    skater&apos;s way to slow the skater down

Long track

  • races are run counter-clockwise
  • individual competition - only two
    skaters are allowed to race at once
  • must remain in their respective lanes
  • skaters must change lanes every lap
  • skater changing from the outside lane
    to the inside has right-of-way
  • team pursuit,the only non-individual
    competition form,
  • two teams of each three skaters are
    allowed to race at once
  • both teams remain in the inner lane
    for the duration of the race they
    start on opposite sides of the rink

Equipment:

Short Track
  • speed skates - use special skates with
    a blade that isn&apos;t attached to the boot
  • boots are usually made of kangaroo leather
  • spandex skin suit with hoods to reduce
    air resistance
  • protective helmet
  • protective eyewear
  • shin pads
  • knee pads
  • neck guard (bib style)
  • kevlar suit(optional)to protect against
    being cut from another skater&apos;s blade

Long Track
  • same equipment should be worn as
    short track
  • exceptions -a helmet, shin pads,
    knee pads, and neck guardnot required

A speed skating rink (or speed skating oval)
  • is an ice rink (but also a sport venue)
    in which a speed skating competition
    is held
  • demarcation of the competition lanes
    are made by painted lines or marks in
    the ice and movable blocks of rubber
  • track must be 400 metres long
    with a warm-up lane at least 4 metres
    wide inside the competition lanes
    track must also be enclosed within
    a building
  • measurement of the track is made
    half a meter into the lane
    total length of the track is distance

      plus the extra distance skated when
      changing lanes in the cross-over area
      on a standard track equals 7 centimeters

  • 400 m track with inner radius 25.0 m
    has 113.57 m long straights
  • 400 m track with inner radius 25.5 m
    has 112.00 m long straights

The 500 meter race is skated twice, with both races taking place on the same day. The final result is based on the total time taken over the two races.

In the team pursuit races, men skate 8 laps, and women skate 6. Two teams of three members each take part in each race. The teams start all at once from different sides of the track. Each skater in a team Â«leadsÂ» the group for a time, skating in front to take on all the air resistance. Meanwhile, his partners fall in behind him. The race comes to an end only when the last skater on a team crosses the finish line.

    passes inside the track
  • lead skater has right-of-way
  • skater can be disqualified if they
    cross track another skater by cutting

Equipment:

Short Track
  • speed skates - use special skates with
    a blade that isn&apos;t attached to the boot
  • boots are usually made of kangaroo leather
  • spandex skin suit with hoods to reduce
    air resistance
  • protective helmet
  • protective eyewear
  • shin pads
  • knee pads
  • neck guard (bib style)
  • kevlar suit(optional)to protect against
    being cut from another skater&apos;s blade

A speed skating rink (or speed skating oval)
  • is an ice rink (but also a sport venue)
    in which a speed skating competition
    is held
  • demarcation of the competition lanes
    are made by painted lines or marks in
    the ice and movable blocks of rubber
  • track must be 400 metres long
    with a warm-up lane at least 4 metres
    wide inside the competition lanes
    track must also be enclosed within
    a building
  • measurement of the track is made
    half a meter into the lane
    total length of the track is distance
    a competitor skates each lap
      the length of two straights
      one inner and one outer curve
      plus the extra distance skated when
      changing lanes in the cross-over area
      on a standard track equals 7 centimeters

  • 400 m track with inner radius 25.0 m
    has 113.57 m long straights
  • 400 m track with inner radius 25.5 m
